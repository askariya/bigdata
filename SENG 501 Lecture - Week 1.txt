Data Analysis
--> Exploit data to find useful patterns and information
--> Involves methods to:
	- Collect data
	- Inspect quality fo data
	- Extract subsets of data
	- Transform data
	- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
	- Build Models from Data 

__Example__

Dependant Variables (y):
	- Commute Time

Independent Variables (x):
	- Accidents
	- Weather 
	- Day of the week
	- etc.

f = model

y = f(x) 

__Correlation__
- Correlation != Causation
- If a and b are positively correlated 
	- Temptation is to conclude "as a increases, b increases"
	- or "as a decreases, b decreases"
	- This is NOT necessarily true
